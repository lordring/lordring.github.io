On a recent early morning of day, when I browsed weibo on the subway to the office, suddenly I saw somebody recommended the book: _**Soft Skills** The software developer's life manual_ by John Z. Sonmez.  I tried and found its pdf version, and started to read it.  Although goups of people thought this book may be as kind of "_chicken soup for the soul_" for the **programmers**, it still gave me some valuable ideas about how to improve myself as SDE. Here I tried to share them.

### Marketing Yourself ###

Marketing is also important for SDE. I knew this, but I just don't know how to market myself. From the book, at least I found a feasible solution: blog.  Before, I tried setup bog several times, and always failed finally due to lack of motivationï¼Œ and consistency which is common thing of many successful bloggers.  

Writing blog not only can help use become a better SDE and communicator, also can help create our brand.

### Produtivity ###

As we know, focus is always the key for productivity. But in our regular work, we always get distracted, such as: popup mails,meetings, interruption by co-workers. Then I saw the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), and I realized that it can solve my current issue. I tried several days, and found out It really worked for me. Every moring when I got to the office, I would firstly setup the todo list and proritize them, and then start working first task by clicking the button. It seems to be a commitment when the button is clicked which means next 25 minutes is reserved for that task, and you don't wanna be interupted. Actually, I knew this technology for a long time, but only now I realize its real value.
