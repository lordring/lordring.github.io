### DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself ###

Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

> When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync.(from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself))

### Orthogonality ###

Orthogonality is an important concept, addressing how a relatively small number of components can be combined in a relatively small number of ways to get the desired results. It is associated with simplicity; the more orthogonal the design, the fewer exceptions. This makes it easier to learn, read and write programs in a programming language.

### Keep knowledge in Plain Text ###

* Insurance against obsolescence
* Leverage
* Easier testing

### The Law of Demeter###

The **Law of Demeter** (**LoD**) or **principle of least knowledge** attempts to minimize coupling between modules in any given program. It tries to prevent you from reaching into an object to gain access to a third object's methods. In its general form, the LoD is a specific case of [loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling).
